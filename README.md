# Automated Vehicle Risk Summary (Core Python)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how raw CSV vehicle data can be cleaned and analysed using core Python libraries to produce an executive-ready risk summary report.

No high-level data libraries (e.g. pandas) were used to highlight strong fundamentals in data handling and analysis.

## Features
- CSV parsing with built-in Python tools
- Data cleaning and validation
- Risk classification using percentiles
- Automated report generation
- Business-readable output

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (csv, os, numpy)
- Data cleaning
- Aggregations & percentages
- Analytical thinking
- Reporting

## How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy
python risk_summary.py

## Dataset Note
The original dataset is approximately 88 MB and exceeds GitHub's file size limits.

For demonstration purposes, this repository includes a representative sample of the data.
The script works identically on the full dataset when run locally.
